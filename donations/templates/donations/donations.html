                    Outreach RMS has been created and developed as an open source referral management system. The intended audience is Higher Education Providers, with a goal of creating a free platform that allows educational institutes to handle internal and external referrals with ease. Allowing for tracking of referrals in one place, rather than tracking in multiple spreadsheets, emails and documents.
