# Outreach Referral Management System

This is my fourth Milestone Project and will be based around a real world need. The goal of this project is to build a Referral Management System for the Outreach department of a local college. The RMS will help the college grow its existing Outrach department by efficiently tracking local schools the college works with, events at those schools and the referrals gained from each event. These referrals will then be tracked by the RMS as they progress to become students and eventually alumni, this conversion information and other Key Performance Indicators will be accessible via the Dashboard page.

#### Color Scheme

To ensure acessibility I used the [Material.io](https://material.io/) colour tool in combination with the Webaim Contrast Checker. My colour scheme can be seen [here](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=006152&secondary.color=f4f4f4) and the contrast checks for the [Primary colour](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=006152) and [Primary Dark colour](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=00362A)
